Hi, I’m Surayyo Norkobilova – Your Go-To Consultant for Life in Germany
I know how overwhelming moving to Germany can be—new language, tons of paperwork, and unfamiliar systems. I’ve been there too. That’s why I started this consultancy: to help foreigners like you navigate German bureaucracy, understand your options, and settle in confidently. With ten years of experience supporting internationals in Germany, I offer personalized, practical help—whether it's registering your address, applying for a visa, or just understanding how health insurance works. Let me help you save time, avoid stress, and feel at home.
